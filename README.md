[1] Li He and Hong Zhang, Two-Step Nystrom Sampling for Large-scale Kernel Approximation, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Big Data

This paper presents a new style of Nystrom sampling by using two landmark sets, a large set and a small-but-optimized one. 
Our method improves the approximation accuracy without additional embedding time cost, hence is suitable for large-scale kernel approximation where embedding time cost is the bottleneck. 

Our method is also complementary to other Nystrom sampling and can be plugged-in to improve their embedding accuracy.
